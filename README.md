# ExpectedPasses

In this free academic project, we concentrate on passes mades by a football team . We created a metric by a novative technique that we can call "expectedPass which is  the probability of a pass being succeeded knowing the passer, its location, the receiver and its location. Such a metric is useful for the post-game analysis where we can see which passes could have been done but also which simple passes were failed and which difficult passes were suceed.
We showed finally that the Bayesian Network worked really well, even with not a large dataset
and it is possible also to predict the "expectedPass" without having all the conditionnal variables
value.
